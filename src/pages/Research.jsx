                As a researcher, I am deeply fascinated by the question of how
                power is sustained and reproduced. I have explored this question
                primarily in the context of authoritarian regimes, focusing
                specifically on elections, nation branding and Southeast Asia.

                Elections
              </h2>
              <p className="mb-4 text-text-dark">
                My research in this area explores the role elections play in
                authoritarian regimes. Most contemporary authoritarian regimes
                hold regular, even competitive elections, but authoritarian
                elections are often manipulated to ensure the regime’s
                continuous grip on power. There are many different ways in which
                authoritarian regimes can manipulate electoral contests, ranging
                from ballot box stuffing to banning of opposition parties, but I
                am particularly interested in understanding how and why formally
                independent election commissions contribute to electoral
                manipulation in these contexts.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4 text-text-dark">
                In my work, I argue that the establishment of formally
                independent election commissions creates a set of challenges
                that may become part of the problem why elections in
                authoritarian regimes fail to deliver change in power. Delving
                deep into the roles, responsibilities, powers, and
                organisational structures of election commissions and their
                relationships with different electoral stakeholders, I show how
                formally independent election commission can become
                authoritarian gatekeepers, hindering prospects for democracy in
                some contexts.

                Nation Branding
              </h2>
              <p className="mb-4 text-text-dark">
                My work in this area is inspired by the changing nature of
                contemporary authoritarianism, both domestically and in its
                interactions with the outside world. It brings together
                scholarship in the disciplines of comparative politics,
                international relations and critical geopolitics. Nation
                branding is a popular practice among authoritarian regimes but
                has attracted relatively little interest among politics and
                international relations scholars.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4 text-text-dark">
                The core argument of my research work is that nation branding
                forms an integral part of state legitimation processes in
                authoritarian regimes. Because of this, we need to stop seeing
                nation branding as an externally oriented, business-derived
                practice and instead understand it as an inherently
                inward-looking promotional strategy aimed at shaping the social
                attitudes and behaviours of the nation’s citizens in line with
                the government’s domestic agenda and legitimation needs.

                Southeast Asia
              </h2>
              <p className="mb-4 text-text-dark">
                Southeast Asia has a long history of authoritarian rule and
                continues to be home to many different forms of
                authoritarianism. This makes it a fascinating region to study.
                By examining the different characteristics of Southeast Asian
                authoritarianism, we can gain a better understanding of the
                factors that enable authoritarianism to persist and even thrive
                in this diverse region.

              <p className="mb-4 text-text-dark">
                In this area, I am currently working on a research article that
                examines the extent to which the US-China rivalry maps on the
                domestic political attitudes of Thai citizens. The paper’s
                findings will have important implications for our understanding
                of how China’s rise affects popular attitude towards democracy
                in Southeast Asia whilst demonstrating the need to understand
                the effects of the US-China rivalry beyond focusing on the level
                of the political elites.

                Overall, my research contributes to the study of
                authoritarianism by exploring a range of issues across different
                countries and contexts. By gaining a comprehensive understanding
                of how authoritarian power is sustained and reproduced, I hope
                to inform efforts on how to promote democracy around the world
                in more effective and culturally and context-sensitive ways.
